# code-similarity
Code and other files for my thesis, primarily involving an efficient way of finding semantic + syntactic similarity between code.

The main motivation was that just like you can search for images, videos, music etc online, there is no special tool for searching code (code is generally treated as pure-text). Because code is well structured, we want to be able to search for code blocks rather than keywords. To do this, we try to flatten the Abstract Syntax Tree of Java methods with some novel feature engineering and hope to see better code recommendations.
